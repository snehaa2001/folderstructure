1. Write and share a small note about your choice of system to schedule periodic tasks (such as downloading list of ISINs every 24 hours). Why did you choose it? Is it reliable enough; Or will it scale? If not, what are the problems with it? And, what else would you recommend to fix this problem at scale in production?

I would like to share my thoughts on the choice of a system to schedule periodic tasks, such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours. In this rapidly evolving tech landscape, selecting the right task scheduling system is crucial to ensure reliability, scalability, and efficiency.

After careful consideration, I recommend using Apache Airflow as the preferred choice for scheduling periodic tasks. Here's why:

I would like to share my thoughts on the choice of a system to schedule periodic tasks, such as downloading a list of ISINs every 24 hours. In this rapidly evolving tech landscape, selecting the right task scheduling system is crucial to ensure reliability, scalability, and efficiency.

After careful consideration, I recommend using Apache Airflow as the preferred choice for scheduling periodic tasks. Here's why:

1. Reliability: Apache Airflow is known for its robustness and reliability. It offers features like task retries and monitoring, making it resilient to failures. This ensures that even if a task fails, it will be retried automatically, reducing the chances of data loss or missed updates.

2. Scalability: Apache Airflow is designed to handle both small and large-scale workflows. It can easily scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes, making it suitable for growing tasks and increasing data volumes. This ensures it can handle the demands of a production environment.

3. Flexibility: Airflow's flexibility is one of its major strengths. It supports a wide range of task types and allows for complex workflows and dependencies. This means that as your ISIN download process evolves, Airflow can adapt to meet your changing needs.

4. Monitoring and Alerting: Airflow provides built-in monitoring and alerting capabilities. You can easily set up notifications for task failures or other issues, ensuring that you are promptly notified of any problems.

5. Community and Ecosystem: Apache Airflow has a thriving community and a rich ecosystem of plugins and integrations. This means you can leverage pre-built solutions for common tasks and easily find support and resources if needed.

While Apache Airflow is a strong choice, it's essential to consider potential challenges:

1. Learning Curve: Implementing and configuring Airflow may have a learning curve for your team if they are not already familiar with it. However, the benefits outweigh the initial effort.

2. Resource Intensive: Airflow can be resource-intensive, especially when dealing with a large number of tasks. Proper resource management and scaling are crucial to address this concern.
